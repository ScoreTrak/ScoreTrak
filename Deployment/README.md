# Deployments

## Trying/Testing/Development
For development purposes, it is best to use one of the following:
 - [docker-nsq](./docker-nsq/README.md)
 - [docker-standalone](./docker-nsq/README.md)
 - [local](./local/README.md)

## Production
For full fledged production deployment we suggest using [kubernetes](./kubernetes-nsq/README.md) or [swarm](./swarm-nsq/README.md) deployments
